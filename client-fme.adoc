=== Client FME

==== Vector Queries
Vector queries in the FME Client can be performed two ways:
- interactively using FME Data Inspector as the client alone
- FME Workbench with a workspace script to automate the process

=== Raster Queries
When FME is used to read a geopackage raster tile dataset, the Data Inspector client optimizes the display by balancing the displayed resolution with the zoom level. Unless a specific zoom level is chosen, FME automatically chooses the highest resolution zoom level that can be displayed at the extents chosen, and then resamples as needed.
