=== GeoPackage Results

==== Raster and vector data in one file

The GeoPackage standard and NSG profile permit a user to include both raster and vector data in the same file. One provider combined the GGDM vector data with a patch of imagery at a higher resolution than the supplied Sentinel 2A data and also added an elevation raster dataset. Although their demo exceeded the scope of the prescribed tests, it highlighted the potential for doing useful raster/vector mashups within NSG profile guidelines. This screenshot shows the edge of the imagery patch overlaid on a public basemap.

==== Sort Attributes in SQLite schema
Sort attributes alphabetically in the SQLite schema. If not, it is hard to find attributes in user interfaces to select features to filter.

==== Remove local links
If GeoPackage files contain links to data producer local file system, some data (e.g styles) might not be accessible.

==== Investigate further GDAL Validation issues

Several GDAL validation issues were reported that require further investigation with GDAL developers:

==== Investigate further GeoPackage performance
Some files >600 MB were slower to load. Need to investigate further the raw causes of such behavior.

Two files in Sprint 1 with raster data were 1 GB and 5 GB. Raster queries were easy to perform.

==== Investigate further transparency
Some clients reported apparent transparency in raster layers.

==== Mashups containing raster elevation data

Various clients were able to open the file containing both raster and vector data. The GeoPackage contained high resolution images and elevation data in the 2D gridded coverage extension schema. Tile-based, pyramidal, floating-point raster data is a distinguishing feature of GeoPackage.
