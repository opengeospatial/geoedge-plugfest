=== Summary of experiments

The results of Sprint 1 were summarized in the following table.
[[Sprint1Results]]

The first row provides the label used to identify each client in an anonymized way. For example: Client E, Client L, etc. In total ten clients were used in the Plugfest.

The first column identifies the sources of data and servers. The contributions were also anonymized. They were sorted in the table by the type of contribution. For example, the Plugfest had 3 WMTS servers: Pluto, Calypso and Oberon.

The red marks indicate that the client was not able to interact with the server provider. Overall most servers were able to communicate with the clients.

The results for Sprint 2 are shown in the <<Sprint2Results>> table. Similar to the previous table, it shows if a client was able to interact with the server provider. In addition, it was also captured by shading the cells green if the client was able to successfully perform all the tests with a particular source.
