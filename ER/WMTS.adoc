==== Axis Order

Data providers should treat properly urn:ogc:def:crs:epsg::4326 (or EPSG:4326) depending on the specification they are implementing.  EPSG:4326 AXIS order is YX. Here is the guideline:

* OGC WMS 1.1.1 mandates XY - ordering
* OGC WMS 1.3 mandates official axis ordering. If EPSG:4326 is being used the axis order should be YX
