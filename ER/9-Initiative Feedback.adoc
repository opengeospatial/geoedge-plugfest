In a distributed initiative like this one, the ability to provide the necessary feedback, in a concise and straightforward way, and make the discussion happen between all the interested parts is fundamental. It is also important to be able to keep track of what happened and be able to get a quick status overview, e.g. show me all the issues related with WFS.

GitHub issues was a good choice for this. The simple UI (not simpler) make GitHub issues easy to use by both technical and non-technical people. The labels mechanism provide a good way of managing the issues and the discussion mechanism (with the associated notifications mechanism) is very efficient to use. When creating an issue and assigning it to the interested persons, GitHub will take care of notifying those persons, making them aware of that issue.

In an ideal world, everyone involved with the created issue should be able to reproduce it in their own environment (debuggable environment), unfortunately this is usually not the case. People work on different environments, they donâ€™t have access to the same clients or servers, etc. This means that special care should be taken when describing an issue.

Improving the information provided in an issue will help all the interested parties better understand the issue and solve the problem. For example, when describing an issue related with an UI, a simple GIF visually showing the problem, is usually easier to interpret than a verbal description. When describing an issue involving a client invoking a server, the actual request send by the client to the server is a fundamental piece of information, or an alternative is to reproduce the issue with a client that is commonly available, like https://qgis.org/en/site/[QGIS] for example.
