==== Complex Queries


Some queries seem difficult to execute. Several clients reported that Query 10 can't be executed:

  Query 10: Find the administrative subdivision that contains the building “Cuerpo de Bomberos de Orocovis”

The process might involve a 2 step process:

  Select the layer
  Run a query inside that layer: select * from BUILDING_P WHERE ZI005_FNA="Cuerpo de Bomberos de Orocovis";
