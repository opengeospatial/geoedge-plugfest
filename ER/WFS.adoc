==== Axis order

Data providers should treat properly urn:ogc:def:crs:epsg::4326. The axis order is Latitude Longitude. This can happen in the following situations:

 1. When performing an HTTP request
 2. When returning data about a feature

The snippet code bellow shows an incorrect axis order for Puerto Rico.

==== Query issues


Some queries seem difficult to execute. Several clients reported that Query 10 can't be executed:

  Query 10: Find the administrative subdivision that contains the building “Cuerpo de Bomberos de Orocovis”

The process might involve a 2 step process:

  1. Select the layer
  2. Run a query inside that layer: select * from BUILDING_P WHERE ZI005_FNA="Cuerpo de Bomberos de Orocovis";

Similarly it was reported that it was only possible to query one layer per request (https://github.com/opengeospatial/geoedge-plugfest/issues/52[Issue 52]).

A thin client didn't support attribute querying (https://github.com/opengeospatial/geoedge-plugfest/issues/85[Issue 85]).

==== Interacting with different versions WFS

Some servers support multiple version of WFS. This server capability enables clients to get the data using the preferred version of a WFS.
